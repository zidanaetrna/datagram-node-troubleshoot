**Q: Is idle status normal?**

> **A**: Yes, IDLE status indicates that your node is connected to the datagram network and is eligible to earn uptime rewards.

**Q: Why does my app indicate that it is connected while my browser shows that it is disconnected?**

> **A:** The node application and web dashboard update through different services, which may cause syncing delays. Please refresh your browser after a few minutes. If the issue continues, submit a support ticket for assistance.

**Q: Why is my download being flagged as dangerous and placed in quarantine?**

> **A:** The node application is safe to download and install. The warning for Windows installations is due to a required security certificate, which we have applied for and will update upon approval.

**Q: Can I use the same API key on multiple devices?**

> **A:** Each API key is linked to a single device. Using it on multiple machines will cause errors or disconnect the original device. To run the node on a new device, stop it on the old one, or generate a new API key if allowed.

**Q: How do referral counts work?**

> **A:** Each user receives a unique referral code upon account creation, which can be found on the dashboard, the Referrals page, the Rewards page, and the desktop app main screen.
> 
> When someone uses your referral code, they will initially appear as a “pending” referral. After they achieve at least 100 verified uptime hours (over 4 days), they become “confirmed.”
> 
> At that point, you start earning referral rewards, and they unlock higher daily earnings beyond the 1,000 points/day cap. This system helps filter out inactive users.
> 
> **Referral rewards include:**
> - A one-time bonus (tiered: 1000 / 500 / 250 points)
> - An ongoing percentage bonus (10% / 5% / 3%) based on your referrals' earnings.
